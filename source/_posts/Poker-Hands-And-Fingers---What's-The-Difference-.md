#  Poker Hands And Fingers - What's The Difference? 

One of the most common questions that beginning poker players have is what the difference is between a poker hand and a finger. 

In poker, a hand is five cards that are dealt to each player. A player's hand is made up of the two cards they are originally dealt (known as their pocket cards), plus the three community cards that are placed in the middle of the table after the first three rounds of betting (also known as the flop). 

In contrast, fingers are what you use to grip and hold your cards. Most people have ten fingers, which means that you can hold up to ten cards at once. 

The main difference between hands and fingers is that hands are competing against each other, while fingers are used to grip and hold your cards. In other words, your goal with hands is to make the best five-card hand possible, while your goal with fingers is to keep your cards as safe as possible. 

That's not to say that you can't win a hand by bluffing; you definitely can. But bluffing is much more difficult when you're not holding your cards in your hands. 

There are a few different grips that you can use when playing poker, but the most popular one is called the fan grip. To do this grip, hold your cards with four fingers on one side of the card and your thumb on the other side. This will allow you to see all of your cards at once and make it easier for you to take notes on your opponents' hands. 

If you're playing in a live game and don't want to flash your pocket cards around, you can also use the knock-knock grip. To do this grip, hold your cards so that they are perpendicular to your body with one end pointing towards your opponent. This will hide your pocket cards from view and prevent them from being easily read. 

Finally, if you're playing online or on a mobile device, you can use the bridge grip. This grip involves holding your cards so that they form an upside-down V shape. This will allow you to see all of your cards at once and make it easier for you to enter bets and respond to raises. 

So now that you know the difference between poker hands and fingers, put these tips into practice and start crushing those Texas Hold'em games!

#  How To Play Poker: The Poker Hands And Fingers 

In poker, the hands are ranked according to their power, from weakest to strongest. The ranking of the hands is very important in order to make the best possible decisions while playing. In this article, we will take a look at each hand and how it is played.

The first hand that we will look at is the pair. A pair is made up of two cards of the same rank. When playing a pair, you want to try and get as many of your other chips into the pot as possible. You can either raise or call with a pair, depending on the situation. If there are several players in the hand, you want to make sure that you are not giving away too much information by betting too much.

The next hand is two pair. This hand is made up of two pairs of different ranks. When playing two pair, you want to try and get as many of your other chips into the pot as possible just like with a pair. However, since you have more potential for winning with this hand, you may want to be more aggressive when betting and raising.

The next hand is three of a kind. This hand is made up of three cards of the same rank. When playing three of a kind, you should bet or raise as much as you can in order to build a large pot. You want to try and scare off any other players who may have a better hand than you do.

The next hand is a straight. A straight consists of five cards in consecutive rank order, such as 5-6-7-8-9. When playing a straight, you want to try and get as many of your other chips into the pot as possible. You should also be willing to fold if you believe that someone has a better hand than you do.

The next hand is four of a kind. This hand is made up of four cards of the same rank. When playing four of a kind, you should bet or raise as much as possible in order to build a large pot. You want to try and scare off any other players who may have a better hand than you do.

The final hand that we will look at is a full house. A full house consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as 3-3-2-2-A). When playing full house, you should bet or raise as much money as possible in order to win the pot outright. There is no need to be scared off by anyone with this powerful hand!

#  What Do The Poker Hands And Fingers Represent? 

The poker hands and fingers are considered to have a lot of symbolism in our culture. Each finger is believed to have a certain meaning, and the hands themselves can say a lot about a person. Here is a look at what each finger and hand position might mean:

# The Thumb 

The thumb is often seen as the strongest finger, and it is associated with power and strength. In poker, the thumb could represent the player's determination or stubbornness. It can also indicate that the player is not afraid to take risks.

# The Index Finger 

The index finger is seen as the symbol of truth, justice, and righteousness. It can indicate that the player is fair-minded and honest. In poker, this finger could represent the player's willingness to bluff or bet big.

# The Middle Finger 

The middle finger is often seen as the symbol of rebellion and disrespect. It can indicate that the player is feeling hostile or aggressive. In poker, this finger might mean that the player is ready to go all-in with their chips.

# The Ring Finger 

The ring finger is seen as the symbol of love and affection. It often indicates that the player is feeling emotional or sentimental. In poker, this finger might mean that the player wants to slow down the game and take their time with their decisions.

#  All You Need To Know About Poker Hands And Fingers 

In poker, the strength of your hand is determined by the rank of the cards and the suit. There are 13 possible poker hands, from weakest to strongest:

High card 
One pair 
Two pair 
Three of a kind 
Straight 
Flush 
Full house 
Four of a kind 
 Straight flush 
Royal flush.


The rank of each card is as follows: ace (high), king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. So for example, a three of a kind composed of three kings would be the strongest possible hand. If two players have identical hands then the pot is split between them.


Nowadays almost all poker is played electronically with cards that are not visible to the players. In this case the suits are irrelevant and only the ranks of the cards matter. When two players have equally ranked hands (e.g. two pair) then the player with the highest ranking individual card in their hand (the ‘kicker’) wins. For example if two players have two pair – Aces and 2s – then the player with an Ace kicker would win.




# The Different Poker Hands 
There are 13 different types of poker hands in total and they are listed below in ascending order from weakest to strongest:
1) High Card: This is any hand that doesn’t have a pair or anything stronger. For example, if you have an Ace, King and Two playing together then you would have three high cards. 2) One Pair: This is a hand that has two cards of equal rank (e.g. two Queens). If both players have one pair then the highest ranking pair wins. 3) Two Pair: This is a hand that has two pairs of cards with different ranks (e.g. Queen-Jack-Ten-Two). As with one pair hands, if both players have two pairs then the highest ranking pair wins it all. 4) Three of a Kind: This is a hand where you have three cards of equal rank (e.g sixes). If both players have three-of-a-kinds then whoever has higher ranked individual card(s) will win - so for instance if one player has 6-6-5 and another player has 6-6-4 then the first player would win as their 5 kicker beats out the 4 kicker of their opponent . 5) Straight: This is five consecutive cards (e .. g ace , 2 , 3 , 4 ,5 ). If both players have straights then the one withhigher ranked cards will win - so for instance if one player holds an ace-king-queen straight while another player holds a two-three-four straight ,the first player will win as their straight contains higher rankedcards than their opponents . 6) Flush: This is when all five cards are of same suit e .. gclubs ).If both playershave flushes then whoever hashigher rankedcard will win . 7 ) Full House :Thisis when youhavethreeof acardandtwoofanother e .. gQueen– Jack -Ace ).Ifbothplayershave fullhousesthenhighestrankingthreeofthefivecardswins . 8 ) Four Of A Kind :Thisis when youhave fourcardsof equalrank e .. g fourQueens).Ifbothplayershave fourofakindthenhighestrankingindividualcardwillwin . 9 ) Straight Flush :Thisisahandcontainingfivesequentialcardsof same suit e .. g tenaceclubs ).Ifbothplayershavestraightflushes thenthepottwillbetwoeachplayer . 10) Royal Flush:Thisisahandcontainingace , king , queen , jack and ten all in sequence from lowest to highest and all of same suit e .. g spades ).
