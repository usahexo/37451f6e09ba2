Slot machines come in all shapes and sizes and with all manner of bells and whistles. But one thing is for sure – they're all designed to take your money. In a way, that's the point, right? If it weren't for the prospect of big payouts, people probably wouldn't be so keen on playing slots. So, when you do hit the jackpot, it's always an exciting moment.

There are all sorts of myths and legends surrounding slot machines and their payouts. One such legend is the story of the Fort Knox jackpot. The premise of this story is that there is a slot machine somewhere out there that's rigged to payout a massive sum of money – often millions of dollars.

Is there any truth to this legend? It's hard to say for sure. Certainly, there have been cases where people have hit major jackpots on slot machines. But whether or not those jackpots were won on a specific machine at a specific casino is anyone's guess.
