#  Roller Casino Thief Steals Thousands in Unclaimed Winnings

In a stunning turn of events, a thief has stolen thousands of dollars in unclaimed winnings from the Roller Casino.

The thief entered the casino through an open window on the first floor and proceeded to the locked room containing the unclaimed winnings. After forcing his way into the room, the thief made off with approximately $10,000 in cash.

Security footage from the casino shows a masked figure entering and leaving the room in under two minutes, making it clear that this was a well-planned robbery.

This is not the first time that an incident like this has taken place at Roller Casino. In fact, this is the third such robbery in as many months. In all three cases, the thieves targeted the room containing unclaimed winnings.

Given that these incidents have been taking place on a regular basis, it's clear that casino security needs to be stepped up. In particular, it's important to find ways to better secure the room containing unclaimed winnings.

In light of these recent events, Roller Casino is urging players to claim their winnings as soon as possible. If you have any questions about how to claim your winnings, be sure to contact customer support for assistance.

#  $100,000 in Unclaimed Gambling Winnings Up for Grabs

A recent study by the [Gambling Commission](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news-action-and-statistics/news/2017/New-research-shows-UK- gambles-more-than-anyone-else.aspx) found that British citizens lost an astounding £13.8 billion to gambling in 2016, with only £2.5 billion of that coming from regulated gambling sites. That leaves a whopping £11.3 billion wagered through bookies, casinos, and private betting groups, all of which fall outside of government regulation and offer little to no consumer protections.

While it's not clear how much of that £11.3 billion was won by players, it's safe to assume that a good chunk of it is still sitting in unclaimed winnings waiting to be claimed by rightful owners. In fact, one recent report puts the figure at a cool $100,000 in unclaimed winnings just from the state of Nevada!

So how do you go about claiming your lost winnings? The process can be a little daunting, but we're here to help walk you through it. Here are the steps you need to take:

1) Locate any outstanding winnings owed to you

The first step is to find any and all outstanding winnings owed to you. This might sound like a daunting task, but there are a few ways you can go about it.

One way is to check the website of your national gambling authority. Most countries have one, and they usually have a list of all unclaimed winnings as well as instructions on how to claim them. Alternatively, you can try contacting your local police department or fraud department and asking if they have any information on unclaimed gambling winnings.

2) Gather all relevant documents
 as evidence of ownership

Once you've located your unclaimed winnings, the next step is to gather all relevant documents as evidence of ownership. This might include things like betting slips, casino payout slips, bank statements showing transactions related to gambling, etc. Basically, anything that can prove that those funds are rightfully yours should be included in your submission packet.

3) Submit a claim package to the appropriate authority

Once you've gathered all your documents, the final step is submitting a claim package to the appropriate authority. This will vary depending on your country/state of residence, so be sure to consult their website or contact them directly for more information. Included in your submission packet should be all of your documents as well as a cover letter explaining why you believe those funds are yours and how you came across the information about them being unclaimed.

#  Forgotten Winnings Could Fund College Tuition

It's no secret that college tuition rates are on the rise, leaving students and families struggling to afford this necessary investment. A recent study by LendEDU found that the average student loan debt for the Class of 2017 was $39,400. And that's just for undergraduate studies!

There is some good news, though. According to the study, there is $2.6 trillion in unclaimed money and assets floating around out there. That's enough to cover the cost of college for more than 41 million students!

So where is all this money hiding? Much of it is dispersed among forgotten bank accounts, life insurance policies, and stock shares. In some cases, it may be lying dormant in an old safety deposit box or even buried in a backyard!

The first step in claiming any unclaimed funds is to conduct a search. You can start by visiting Unclaimed.org or MissingMoney.com. Both of these websites offer free searches and will help you identify any forgotten assets you may have coming to you. Be sure to check all your family members' names as well – unclaimed money often goes through generations before being claimed!

If you do find some unclaimed money waiting for you, don't wait another minute to claim it! The process of claiming your funds can be long and tedious, but with the help of a reputable organization like Unclaimed.org or MissingMoney.com, it can be done quickly and easily. And remember – having this extra cash available could mean the difference between graduating college with little or no debt!

#  Roller Casino Owner Asks Customers to Claim Gambling Earnings

The owner of the Roller Casino has asked its customers to come forward and claim their gambling earnings. The casino, which is located in Edinburgh, has announced that it will be closing its doors in the coming weeks. The announcement was made earlier this week, with the casino’s owner stating that he hopes customers will come forward and collect any winnings they may have.

According to reports, the casino is estimated to owe its customers approximately £500,000 in winnings. This includes both small and large wins, with the casino’s owner stating that he wants to do right by all of his customers. In order to ensure that everyone has a chance to collect their winnings, the casino is giving its customers a month to come forward and claim their prize.

This announcement comes as a surprise to many, as Roller Casino has been a staple in Edinburgh for over two decades. The closure of the casino leaves many people wondering what will happen to its employees. So far, no decisions have been made regarding the future of the employees. However, it is believed that they will be given an opportunity to find other work within the company.

It is not clear why Roller Casino is choosing to close its doors at this time. However, many people are speculating that it may have something to do with recent changes in gambling laws. Whatever the reason may be, it is clear that the closure of this casino will leave many people disappointed.

#  $1 Million in Unclaimed Winnings from Roller Casino

A recent study by the BBC has shown that there is over $1 million in unclaimed winnings from Roller Casino, a popular online casino game.

The study found that out of the 1,000 players who had won the largest prizes, around three-quarters of them had not yet claimed their winnings. Players can claim prizes of up to £500,000 on the game, but so far only £250,000 has been paid out.

Roller Casino is a game based on the traditional casino game of roulette. It is available to play on desktop and mobile devices and has proved to be hugely popular since its launch in 2014.

The game's creators, Jumpman Gaming, say that they are 'unsurprised' by the findings of the BBC study. A spokesperson for the company said: "With prizes worth up to £500,000 waiting to be won, it's no wonder so many people are yet to claim their rewards."

So if you're one of those people who's been lucky enough to win on Roller Casino – don't forget to come and collect your prize!
