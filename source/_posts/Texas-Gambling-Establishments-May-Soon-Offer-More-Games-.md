#  Texas Gambling Establishments May Soon Offer More Games 

Texas gambling establishments may soon start offering more games, as the Texas Legislature looks to expand gambling in the state. Currently, Texas gambling establishments are limited to playing poker and blackjack. If the proposed legislation is passed, they will also be able to offer craps, roulette and slot machines.

The proposed legislation would also allow the state’s two racetracks to offer gambling on sporting events. This would include bets on professional and collegiate sporting events.

Supporters of the legislation argue that it will result in more tax revenue for the state. They also say that it will create jobs and that it will be a boon to the state’s economy.

Opponents of the legislation argue that it will lead to more gambling addiction and that it will result in more crime. They also argue that it is wrong to allow the state’s two racetracks to offer gambling on sporting events.

The proposed legislation is currently pending before the Texas Legislature. It is not clear if it will pass or not.

#  Texas Lawmakers Consider Allowing More Casino Games 

This week, Texas lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow more casino games in the state. The proposal would legalize new casino games like roulette and blackjack, as well as poker and bingo.

Supporters of the measure argue that it would help generate much-needed revenue for the state. They also say that it would create jobs and attract new tourists to Texas.

Opponents of the bill, meanwhile, argue that it would lead to more gambling addiction and social problems. They also say that it would be harmful to local businesses.

So far, there is no clear consensus on the bill among lawmakers. It is still uncertain whether it will pass or not.

#  Proposed Bill Could Expand Gambling Options In Texas 

A new bill has been proposed in the Texas legislature that would legalize a number of new gambling options in the state.

The proposed bill, House Bill 2234, was filed by State Representative Rafael Anchia on February 12th.

If passed, the bill would legalize various forms of casino gambling, including blackjack, poker, and slot machines. It would also legalize daily fantasy sports betting and online gambling.

Proponents of the bill argue that it would help to generate much-needed revenue for the state government. They also argue that it would create jobs and promote tourism.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased crime and addiction rates. They also argue that it would be unfair to existing casino operators in the state.

The fate of House Bill 2234 is still uncertain, but it is likely to face a tough battle in the legislature.

#  Texas Lawmakers Mull Over Whether To Expand Casino Games 

Texas lawmakers are considering a new bill that would allow casinos to offer more games, including poker, roulette and craps. The proposed bill, House Bill 3181, was filed by state Representative Gary Elkins on December 5th and is currently under review by the House Licensing and Administrative Procedures Committee.

If passed, the bill would amend the Texas Racing Act to allow licensed casinos in the state to offer any game currently available in a racetrack casino. This would include popular games like blackjack, baccarat and slot machines. Lawmakers say that the expanded gaming options could help boost Texas' economy by generating more revenue for the state.

Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased gambling addiction rates and social problems. They also point out that there is no guarantee that the additional revenue generated by expanded gambling would actually be used for public purposes, as required by law.

So far, there has been no indication as to when the committee will take action on HB 3181.

#  Texas Gambling Laws Could Be Changing Soon

The Texas gambling laws are some of the most restrictive in the nation, but that may be changing soon. A new bill has been introduced in the Texas legislature that would legalize and regulate gambling in the state.

The bill, House Bill 2105, was introduced by Representative Eddie Lucio III last month. The bill would allow for a wide range of gambling activities, including casino games, betting on sports, and playing poker online. It would also create a new Texas Gaming Commission to regulate the industry.

Supporters of the bill say that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state. They point to studies that have shown that regulated gambling can generate tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue each year.

Critics of the bill argue that it could lead to increased crime and addiction rates. They also say that it would be difficult to enforce and could damage the state's reputation.

The bill is currently under review by the House Committee on Licensing and Administrative Procedures. If it is approved by the committee, it will move on to the full House for a vote.
