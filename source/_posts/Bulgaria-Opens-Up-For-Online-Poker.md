#  Bulgaria Opens Up For Online Poker

Bulgaria, a small European Union country, is among the latest to jump on the bandwagon and legalize online poker. The government has put the final touches on a bill that will regulate the game and allow licensed operators to offer it to players within Bulgaria’s borders. Once the legislation is enacted, Bulgaria will join a growing list of countries where online poker is legal and regulated.

The Bulgarian bill was drawn up with help from the country’s Gaming Commission. It sets out specific conditions that must be met by any operator wishing to offer online poker in Bulgaria. They include having a physical presence in the country and being licensed by the Gaming Commission. In addition, operators must pay a 15% tax on gross gaming revenue (GGR), which is considerably lower than some other EU countries.

Players in Bulgaria will be able to access online poker sites through approved websites or apps. They will also be able to play for real money against opponents from all over the world. The minimum age for players is 18, and there are restrictions on how much they can deposit and withdraw each day.

The Bulgarian government sees online poker as a way of boosting tourism in the country. It believes that players from other parts of Europe will visit Bulgaria specifically to play in its regulated online poker rooms. This could lead to an increase in spending by tourists and create new jobs in the hospitality industry.

The legalization of online poker in Bulgaria is good news for players in the country. It means they can enjoy their favorite game in a safe and regulated environment, without having to worry about getting scammed or cheated. In addition, playing at licensed sites gives them access to a wide range of tournaments and cash games, as well as generous bonus offers

#  Bulgaria Welcomes Online Poker Players

The Bulgarian government has embarked on a new campaign to attract online poker players to its jurisdiction. Bulgaria is one of a handful of European Union countries that does not currently have a ban on online poker, and officials believe that the country could benefit from the legalization and regulation of the game.

In addition to seeking to legalize and regulate online poker, Bulgaria has also announced plans to establish a dedicated facility for training new poker players. The facility will be open to both amateur and professional players, and will offer educational programs, training seminars, and workshops. Players will also have access to top-level coaching from some of the world’s best professionals.

Bulgaria’s efforts come as other countries in Europe are moving to restrict or prohibit online poker. France recently passed a law that bans all advertising for online poker, while Spain has proposed new legislation that would severely restrict the number of licensed operators in the market.

Many experts believe that Bulgaria’s approach could be successful in attracting players away from these jurisdictions. While there are some restrictions on gambling in Bulgaria, they are not as severe as those in other countries in the region. In addition, Bulgaria offers good value for money when it comes to player liquidity and tournament prize pools.

Bulgaria’s announcement follows similar moves by other European countries to liberalize their gambling markets. Denmark recently became the first country in the world to legalize online gambling, while Sweden is expected to follow suit in 2019.

#  Bulgaria Is A Great Place To Play Online Poker

There are many reasons why Bulgaria is a great place to play online poker. The country has a growing community of poker players, and there are plenty of good poker sites that offer games in Bulgarian leva. Additionally, the Bulgarian government has exempted online poker from its gambling laws, so you can enjoy your games without worrying about getting into trouble with the law.

Bulgaria has a long history of playing poker. The first recorded game of poker in Bulgaria took place in 1872, and the game has been popular ever since. The Bulgarian Poker Federation was founded in 2009, and it organizes tournaments and provides information about the game to Bulgaria's poker players. The federation also works with the government to ensure that online poker is exempt from gambling laws.

There are several good online poker sites that offer games in Bulgarian leva. PokerStars is one of the largest sites, and it offers a wide range of games, including Texas Hold'em, Omaha, and Seven Card Stud. PartyPoker is another large site that offers games in Bulgarian leva, as well as many other languages. It offers a wide variety of tournaments, including Sit & Go tournaments and multi-table tournaments.

If you're looking for a good Bulgarian poker room, I recommend checking out Tonybet Poker. It's a relatively new site, but it offers some great features, including an excellent loyalty program and a wide variety of games. Additionally, it offers support for both Windows and Mac operating systems.

Bulgaria is a great place to play online poker for several reasons:

- There is a growing community of Bulgarian poker players.
- The Bulgarian government has exempted online poker from its gambling laws.
- There are many good online poker sites that offer games in Bulgarian leva.

#  Bulgaria Continues Its Dominance In Online Poker

Bulgaria is continuing its impressive run in online poker, with several players achieving impressive results in major tournaments in recent weeks.

The most notable success came from Stanislav Aleksandrov, who won the €25,000 PokerStars King's Cup: Barcelona event for a prize of €534,000. This was the biggest win of Aleksandrov's career and put him in first place on the Bulgarian all-time money list.

Other Bulgarian players enjoying success in recent tournaments include Ivan Leow (3rd in the €100,000 Super High Roller at the PokerStars Championship Monte Carlo), Dimitar Danchev (2nd in the €1,100 Omaha8 event at the Rozvadov King's Cup) and Krasimir Yankov (winner of the €330 PLO8 tournament at partypoker).

This continued success can be attributed to a number of factors, including the high level of skill among Bulgarian players, as well as their strong determination and focus. Bulgaria also has a well-developed online poker infrastructure, with a wide range of excellent poker sites catering to players from all corners of the globe.

The Bulgarian community is also very supportive, with regular tournaments and social events organised to bring players together. This sense of community is another factor that contributes to Bulgaria's success in online poker.

#  Bulgaria Looks To Regulate And Tax Online Poker

The Bulgarian government is looking to pass a bill that will regulate and tax online poker. The proposed bill is set to be discussed in parliament in the coming weeks, with the goal of it becoming law by the end of the year.

The Bulgarian gambling authority, the Commission for Gambling and Prevention of Money Laundering (CGPL), has been working on the bill for some time. The new law would see online poker operators pay a 5% tax on gross gaming revenue. Operators would also be required to have a license from the CGPL in order to offer services in Bulgaria.

This is not the first time that Bulgaria has tried to regulate online poker. In 2016, a proposal was made to legalize and tax online poker, but it failed to pass parliament. This latest effort seems more likely to succeed, as the government is eager to boost its coffers with extra revenue.

The proposed bill has met with mixed reactions from the poker community. Some players are unhappy with the 5% tax, as they feel it is too high. Others are happy that at least some regulation is being put in place, as this will provide some peace of mind and ensure that operators are reputable.

It is not yet clear when the bill will be voted on by parliament, or whether it will face any opposition. If it does pass, Bulgaria will become one of the few countries in Europe to regulate and tax online poker. This could pave the way for other countries in the region to follow suit, as they look to cash in on this growing industry.
