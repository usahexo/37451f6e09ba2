#  5 States Where Online Poker is 100% Legal

#  Nevada Now Offers Full-scale Online Poker

After a long wait, Nevada has finally announced the availability of full-scale online poker. poker operators in the state can now offer the game to players aged 21 and up.

This comes as great news for Nevada poker enthusiasts, who have been eagerly waiting for this development. The move is also likely to benefit the state's economy, as it will generate more revenue for the government.

Nevada is one of only three states in the US that offers legal online poker. The other two states are Delaware and New Jersey. These states were given the go-ahead to offer online poker by a federal judge in 2013.

Since then, Nevada has been working on developing a comprehensive regulatory framework for online poker. This framework was finally approved by the Nevada Gaming Commission earlier this year.

Under the new framework, poker operators must obtain a license from the state in order to offer online poker. They must also comply with a number of regulations, including anti-money laundering requirements and consumer protection measures.

One of the key benefits of Nevada's online poker framework is its player pool sharing agreement with Delaware and New Jersey. This agreement allows players in all three states to play against each other, which should help increase liquidity and boost the overall player experience.

#  Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey Approve Multi-State Pact to Share Players

In what could be seen as a landmark move in modern interstate cooperation, the Governors of Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey have all ratified a pact to allow their respective states’ players to compete in one another’s regulated online poker and casino markets. The agreement is set to take effect on July 1st, 2019.

The impetus for this agreement appears to be the looming threat of federal intervention in the nascent online gambling industry. The three states are hoping that by working together they can create a large enough market that will be too big for the feds to shut down.

Nevada has been at the forefront of online gambling regulation since it legalized poker websites in 2013. Delaware followed suit later that year, and New Jersey legalized both poker and casino games in 2013 before amending its laws in 2018 to allow sports betting as well.

The three states have had varying levels of success when it comes to attracting players. New Jersey has consistently had the largest market share, but Nevada and Delaware have both seen their player pools dwindle in recent years. It is hoped that this new agreement will reverse that trend and create a larger pool of players who can easily shift from site to site depending on where they are located.

There are still some details that need to be ironed out before the pact goes into effect. One important question is how rake will be shared between the states. Another issue is which licensing authority will oversee operations in each state.

Regardless of those minor details, this move signals a new era of cooperation between states with regard to online gambling, and could pave the way for similar agreements in other industries.

#  European Union online poker Regulations Now in Place

The European Union has announced its new regulations for online poker, which will take effect on July 1, 2019. These regulations are aimed at protecting consumers and ensuring a fair and safe online gambling experience.

Under the new regulations, operators wishing to offer online poker services within the EU must be licensed in at least one member state. This licensing requirement applies both to operators who already offer online poker services and to those who wish to enter the market.

To be eligible for a license, operators must meet a number of requirements, including offering their services in a language that is accessible to players in all EU member states, and providing customer support in all official EU languages. They must also ensure that their systems are secure and that their customers are protected against fraud and money laundering.

Finally, operators must comply with a number of advertising and marketing restrictions. For example, they may not advertise in a way that targets minors or encourages gambling addiction. They may also only promote their services through approved channels, such as licensed websites and land-based casinos.

These new regulations come after years of debate within the EU over how best to regulate online poker. Some member states, such as Spain, were in favor of stricter regulations, while others, such as the United Kingdom, argued for less stringent rules. The final regulations reflect a compromise between these opposing views.

Players can expect a more level playing field under the new regulations, as operators will now be subject to the same rules regardless of where they are based within the EU. This should also lead to increased consumer protection, as operators will be required to meet high standards across all member states.

#  Maryland Becomes Latest State to Allow Skill-based Gambling

Maryland has become the latest state to legalize skill-based gambling, joining the likes of Nevada and New Jersey. The new law allows for play of games such as poker, blackjack and slot machines in which the player’s success is based on their skill rather than chance.

Governor Larry Hogan signed the bill into law on Tuesday, with supporters hailing it as a way to bring much-needed revenue to the state. Maryland faces a budget shortfall of $1.5 billion in the next fiscal year, and officials believe that legalizing skill-based gambling could generate up to $200 million in annual revenue.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will lead to more problem gambling, but supporters say that it will be implemented in a responsible way and that there are safeguards in place to protect players. Gambling addiction counselors are available through the state’s casinos and there are also limits on how much money people can spend on games each day.

Under the new law, casinos will be able to offer both electronic and table games that use skills instead of chance to determine winners. This includes games like poker, blackjack, roulette and craps, as well as slots and other casino games. There is a separate category for horse racing betting and lotteries will continue to be offered through the state’s Department of Lottery and Gaming.
