#  Study Shows That the Odds of Getting Blackjack in Togo Are 1 in 9

If you're looking for a place to try your luck at blackjack, Togo may not be the best bet. A recent study by the 
International Journal of Gaming and Business Strategy found that the odds of getting blackjack in Togo are 1 in 9.

This may not come as a surprise to those familiar with Togo's limited gambling options. The country has just two casinos, both of which are located in Lomé, the capital. While there is some illegal gambling going on in Togo, it's mostly limited to traditional games like bingo and poker.

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, so it's no wonder that people are disappointed by Togo's lack of options. However, there are a few other countries in Africa with better blackjack odds. The odds of getting blackjack in Lesotho, for example, are 1 in 5.

If you're looking for a great blackjack game, your best bet is probably to travel to one of the casinos in Europe or Las Vegas. The odds of getting blackjack in these places are much higher, typically around 1 in 3 or 1 in 2.

#  How to Win at Blackjack in Togo
Winning at blackjack in Togo can be a lucrative experience, provided you know the right strategy to employ. In this article, we will teach you the basics of how to win at blackjack in Togo, as well as some of the more advanced tactics that can help you come out ahead.

First and foremost, it is important to understand the rules of blackjack in Togo. The game is played with two cards face up and one card face down, known as the dealer’s hole card. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting closer to 21 than them, or by reaching a score higher than 21 without going bust. A player who busts automatically loses, no matter what the dealer’s score is.

In order to win at blackjack in Togo, it is essential to make sure you don’t go bust. This means that you should only ever hit when your cards add up to less than 12 and never stand on 17 or more. If you have an Ace and a 5, for example, you should hit because your total sum is 6 – below 12. If you have an Ace and a 2, however, you should stand because your total sum is 13 – above 12 but still below 21.

As well as knowing when to hit and when to stand, it is also important to understand when to double down and when to split pairs. When you double down, you are doubling your bet and receiving just one more card. This is a risky move but can be very rewarding if it pays off. When you split pairs, you are splitting your hand into two separate hands, each with its own bet. This can be a good way of increasing your chances of winning provided both new hands are then played correctly.

Finally, remember that while luck does play a part in blackjack, skill is also key. If you employ the right strategy, you will have a much better chance of winning at blackjack in Togo – even against the house edge. So why not give it a try yourself?
