Las Vegas is a city that was built on gambling. From its early days as a small town in the Nevada desert, it has grown into one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations, thanks in no small part to the abundance of casinos and other gaming venues.

Gambling has been around in Las Vegas since its inception as a city. The very first casino to open in Las Vegas was the Southern Club, which was founded in 1905. It didn’t take long for gambling to begin spreading throughout the city, and soon there were dozens of casinos and gambling venues operating in Las Vegas.

This proliferation of gambling establishments led to a rapid increase in tourism to the city. People came from all over the country - and the world - to try their luck at the casinos. In fact, by the 1950s, Las Vegas had become so well known for its casinos that it was known as “the Gambling Capital of the World”.

The success of Las Vegas’s casinos led to ever-increasing competition among them. This competition resulted in ever-more extravagant casino resorts being built in the city, culminating in 1990 with the opening of The Mirage, which was then the largest casino resort in the world.

The Mirage was followed by a wave of even more lavish casino resorts, including Bellagio, Venetian, and Wynn Resorts. These resorts helped cement Las Vegas’s reputation as one of the premier gambling destinations in the world.

Today, gambling remains one of Las Vegas’s biggest draws. The city has over 150 casinos and other gaming venues, and more than 41 million people visit it each year.
