Developed by Shuffle Master in the 1990s, this poker-based game is enjoyed by many players in brick-and-mortar establishments all over the world. At 888 Casino, we offer this game in both our instant play and downloadable versions, giving you plenty of options when it comes time to ante up. But what exactly is Let it Ride, and how do you play it?</p>
<p>In essence, Let it Ride is a five-card stud poker game where you are playing against the dealer, not other players. The goal is to make the best possible five-card hand using two of your own cards and three community cards. After the first three cards are dealt face up (the flop), you can either let your bet ride or pull it back. If you decide to let it ride and the fourth card (the turn) is helpful, you again have the opportunity to let your bet ride or pull it back; if the fifth and final card (the river) is also helpful, then you complete the hand and collect your payout.</p>
<p>If any of your first two cards make a pair with one of the community cards or if you have a queen or better (known as a “qualifying hand”), then you can declare that hand immediately and collect your payout even if no other cards are revealed. Otherwise, the showdown occurs once all betting rounds are complete, and the player with the best five-card hand takes home the pot.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s more to mastering Let it Ride than just knowing what hands to play; there’s also important strategic considerations that come into play. For example, should you let your bet ride after seeing flop or fold if there’s nothing there? Is now a good time to go all-in? Knowing when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em is key to playing this game well - so be sure study up on some basic strategy before hitting the tables at 888 Casino!</p>

This three-card poker game can be enjoyed by novice and experienced players alike, and with a bit of practice, you could be winning big payouts in no time.</p>
<p>In order to play Let it Ride effectively, it’s important to understand the basic rules and strategy involved.

One key tip is to always keep a pair or better when betting - as this will give you a better chance of winning something on each hand. Another recommendation is to fold any hand that doesn’t have an ace or king high, as these cards offer the best chance of taking down the pot.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no guarantee that following these tips will result in consistent wins - but they should at least help improve your chances. With a little bit of practice and some sound strategy-playing, you could be well on your way to enjoying some serious payouts from Let it Ride!</p>
<h1 id="Learn-How-to-Play-Let-it-Ride-for-Maximum-Profit"><a href="#Learn-How-to-Play-Let-it-Ride-for-Maximum-Profit" class="headerlink" title="Learn How to Play Let it Ride for Maximum Profit"></a>Learn How to Play Let it Ride for Maximum Profit</h1><p>You may have seen people playing Let it Ride in a casino, but are unsure as to how the game works or how you can make money from it.</p>
<p>In Let it Ride, players are dealt three cards face down. They then have two options: they can either take back their first card and receive another, or they can let their first card stay. After the player has made their decision, the dealer reveals all three cards. The player then has the option to take back their second card and receive another, or let their second card stay. The dealer then sets the third card in front of the player and bets are revealed.</p>
<p>If the player has a poker hand consisting of two pair or better, they can collect from the middle of the table (the bet amount plus one half of the bet amount for each extra card). If the player doesn’t have a poker hand consisting of two pair or better, they lose their bet amount.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to play Let it Ride for maximum profit. One way is to always let your first card stay, no matter what the card is. This gives you a 18 percent chance of winning and decreases your chances of losing. Another way is to take back your first card if you don’t have anything good (e.g., an ace or king), since you’ll get another shot at a better hand; this increases your chances of winning by about 8 percent while decreasing your chances of losing by about 2 percent.</p>
