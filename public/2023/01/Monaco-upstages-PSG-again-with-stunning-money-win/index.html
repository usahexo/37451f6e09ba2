            <h1 id="Monaco-upstages-PSG-again-with-stunning-money-win"><a href="#Monaco-upstages-PSG-again-with-stunning-money-win" class="headerlink" title="Monaco upstages PSG again with stunning money win"></a>Monaco upstages PSG again with stunning money win</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>It was billed as the match of the season so far. The high-flying Paris Saint Germain side, who had only lost once all season and were unbeaten in their last 18 matches in all competitions, against a Monaco team who were fresh off the back of a Champions League upset against Manchester City.</p>
<p>Things started perfectly for the home side, with Neymar putting them ahead after just eight minutes. But Monaco, and in particular teenage striker Kylian Mbappé, had other ideas. Mbappé equalized just before halftime, and then took the game away from PSG with two goals in three minutes midway through the second half. With some of Europe’s top clubs reportedly interested in signing him, Mbappé’s virtuoso performance will have done his stock no harm at all.</p>
<p>This was Monaco’s biggest victory over PSG since 1982, and it means that they move up to second place in Ligue 1, just three points behind their opponents. Unai Emery’s expensively assembled side now find themselves under pressure to win the title, while Leonardo Jardim’s young team will be confident of qualifying for the Champions League again next season.</p>
<h1 id="Nice-proves-to-be-a-viable-dark-horse-with-big-money-win-over-Marseille"><a href="#Nice-proves-to-be-a-viable-dark-horse-with-big-money-win-over-Marseille" class="headerlink" title="Nice proves to be a viable dark horse with big money win over Marseille"></a>Nice proves to be a viable dark horse with big money win over Marseille</h1><p>In a matchup that pitted Nice against league-leading Marseille, the home side proved they were not to be underestimated, coming away with a resounding 3-0 victory. This was a particularly sweet win for Nice as it snapped Marseille’s undefeated streak and put some distance between themselves and their pursuers.</p>
<p>The game started out cagey, with both sides feeling each other out. Nice came closest to opening the scoring in the first half when Mario Balotelli hit the post after being set up by Wylan Cyprien. Just before halftime, however, Marseille were given a golden opportunity to take the lead when Vincent Koziello was given a straight red card for a rash tackle on Dimitri Payet.</p>
<p>Marseille duly took advantage of their one-man advantage in the second half, but they could not find a way past Yoan Cardinale. Finally, in the 73rd minute, Nice took the lead through Alassane Plea’s close-range finish. The floodgates then opened, with Balotelli doubling the advantage just two minutes later before adding another in stoppage time to seal an emphatic victory.</p>
<p>This result leaves Marseille still in first place but now with just a three-point lead over Nice, who are hot on their heels. With nine games remaining, there is still everything to play for in what is shaping up to be a thrilling title race.</p>
<h1 id="Lyon-rides-hot-streak-with-big-money-win-in-Ligue-1-matchup"><a href="#Lyon-rides-hot-streak-with-big-money-win-in-Ligue-1-matchup" class="headerlink" title="Lyon rides hot streak with big money win in Ligue 1 matchup"></a>Lyon rides hot streak with big money win in Ligue 1 matchup</h1><p>Looking good in Ligue 1 action this past weekend was Lyon, who rode a hot streak to a big money win in their matchup. It was clear that the team had been working hard in practice and it paid off with a 3-0 victory.</p>
<p>This continues Lyon’s resurgence and puts them in a good position to make a strong finish to the season. What makes this performance even more impressive is that they were playing without their star striker, who is currently sidelined with an injury.</p>
<p>The team will need to stay focused as they head into some tougher matchups in the coming weeks, but it looks like they are on the right track.</p>
<h1 id="Caen-shocks-the-world-with-upset-victory-over-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#Caen-shocks-the-world-with-upset-victory-over-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="Caen shocks the world with upset victory over Paris Saint-Germain"></a>Caen shocks the world with upset victory over Paris Saint-Germain</h1><p>CAEN, FRANCE - In a stunning upset, Caen beat reigning Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 on Saturday. The result left PSG coach Unai Emery red-faced and pundit-heads around the world scratching their heads.</p>
<p>The home side got off to a strong start, pressuring PSG from the opening whistle. It was Caen who got on the board first, with Valentin Rongier scoring in the 37th minute. The goal came as a result of some poor defending by PSG, who were unable to clear their lines properly.</p>
<p>The second half began much like the first, with Caen in control of the game. The decisive goal came in the 71st minute, when Yann Karamoh scored following a great counterattack. PSG pulled one back in stoppage time through Edinson Cavani, but it was too little too late.</p>
<p>After the final whistle, Emery was quick to admit that his team had been outplayed: “Today we were not at our best,” he said. “Caen deserved to win.”</p>
<p>Despite their loss, PSG remain atop the Ligue 1 table with 19 points from nine games. Second-place Monaco are four points behind and have played one game more.</p>
<h1 id="Money-woes-continue-for-Bastia-as-they-lose-another-game"><a href="#Money-woes-continue-for-Bastia-as-they-lose-another-game" class="headerlink" title="Money woes continue for Bastia as they lose another game"></a>Money woes continue for Bastia as they lose another game</h1><h2 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p>The French side Bastia continue to have money troubles as they went down 2-0 against Gazelec Ajaccio. This latest setback means that the relegation strugglers have now lost their last four games in all competitions and are without a win since December.</p>
<p>Bastia were dealt an early blow in this game when Gaetan Charbonnier was sent off after just nine minutes. Despite this, they still had chances to take the lead, with Wahbi Khazri and Ryad Boudebouz both going close. However, it was Gazelec who took the lead shortly before halftime through Anthony Modeste. The hosts then doubled their lead in the second half through Frederic Sammaritano.</p>
<p>This result means that Bastia are now six points from safety and look increasingly likely to be relegated from Ligue 1. They will have to overturn this deficit in their remaining games if they are to stay up.</p>
