            <h1 id="Detroit-Lions-Make-History-Become-First-Team-to-Lose-20-Games-in-a-Row"><a href="#Detroit-Lions-Make-History-Become-First-Team-to-Lose-20-Games-in-a-Row" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Lions Make History, Become First Team to Lose 20 Games in a Row"></a>Detroit Lions Make History, Become First Team to Lose 20 Games in a Row</h1><p>The Detroit Lions have made history, becoming the first team in NFL history to lose 20 games in a row. The Lions lost to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, falling to 0-20 on the season.</p>
<p>The Lions have been among the worst teams in the NFL for several years now, but this season has been especially bad. The team has been plagued by injuries, and has had trouble scoring points.</p>
<p>Detroit’s last win came in December of 2016, when they defeated the New Orleans Saints. Since then, they have suffered through 19 consecutive losses.</p>
<p>There have been some close calls along the way, including a pair of overtime defeats and a game where they blew a 14-point fourth quarter lead. But overall, the Lions have simply been unable to win football games.</p>
<p>Now that they have secured the dubious distinction of being the worst team in NFL history, the Lions will look to end their losing streak in 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Detroit-Lions-Looking-to-End-Record-Breaking-Streak-This-Week"><a href="#Detroit-Lions-Looking-to-End-Record-Breaking-Streak-This-Week" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Lions Looking to End Record-Breaking Streak This Week"></a>Detroit Lions Looking to End Record-Breaking Streak This Week</h1><p>The Detroit Lions will be looking to break their record-breaking streak when they face the Miami Dolphins this week. The Lions are coming off of a bye week, and they will be looking to improve on their 3-3 record.</p>
<p>The Dolphins are also coming off of a bye week, and they will be looking to improve on their 3-2 record. This game is important for both teams, and it should be a very close contest.</p>
<p>The Lions are hoping that quarterback Matthew Stafford can continue his strong play. Stafford has been playing very well this season, and he has thrown for 1,532 yards and 11 touchdowns. He has also been very accurate, and he has only thrown one interception.</p>
<p>The Dolphins are hoping that quarterback Ryan Tannehill can continue his solid play. Tannehill has been playing very well this season, and he has thrown for 1,522 yards and nine touchdowns. He has also been very accurate, and he has only thrown two interceptions.</p>
<p>The Lions are hoping to end their record-breaking streak this week. They have lost their last eight games in a row, and they are looking to break that streak this week. The Dolphins are also hoping to end their streak this week. They have lost their last two games in a row, and they are looking to break that streak this week.</p>
<h1 id="Lions-Eyeing-Stand-Against-Packers-on-Sunday"><a href="#Lions-Eyeing-Stand-Against-Packers-on-Sunday" class="headerlink" title="Lions Eyeing Stand Against Packers on Sunday"></a>Lions Eyeing Stand Against Packers on Sunday</h1><p>It would be hard to find a matchup in the NFL that is more highly anticipated than the one between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers this weekend. The Lions have had an impressive start to the season, and are looking to prove that they are a force to be reckoned with in the NFC North. The Packers, meanwhile, are coming off of a disappointing loss to the Atlanta Falcons and will be looking for redemption against their division rivals.</p>
<p>The Lions have been led by their stellar defense this season, which currently ranks first in the league in points allowed. Led by cornerback Darius Slay and defensive end Ezekiel Ansah, Detroit’s defense is sure to give Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers trouble on Sunday. The Packers offense has not been quite as consistent this season as in years past, but they should still be able to move the ball against Detroit’s defense.</p>
<p>The key matchup in this game will be between Detroit’s offensive line and Green Bay’s defensive front-seven. If the Lions can get push in the running game and give quarterback Matthew Stafford time to throw, they will be able to put up plenty of points on Sunday. However, if Green Bay can get pressure on Stafford and stop the run, it could be a long day for Detroit.</p>
<p>Prediction: The Lions will win 24-17</p>
<h1 id="Detroit-Looks-to-Avoid-Becoming-the-Next-0-16-Team"><a href="#Detroit-Looks-to-Avoid-Becoming-the-Next-0-16-Team" class="headerlink" title="Detroit Looks to Avoid Becoming the Next 0-16 Team"></a>Detroit Looks to Avoid Becoming the Next 0-16 Team</h1><p>The Detroit Lions have been one of the most successful NFL franchises in history, winning four league championships and making it to the playoffs a total of 26 times. However, the past two seasons have been a different story, as the team has failed to win a single game, putting them in danger of becoming the first team in NFL history to go 0-16.</p>
<p>While some may write the Lions off as a lost cause, there are still plenty of reasons for fans to be hopeful. For starters, the team has some talented players on both offense and defense, including quarterback Matt Stafford and defensive end Ezekiel Ansah. Additionally, the Lions have made some changes in the coaching staff, hiring head coach Matt Patricia and offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter.</p>
<p> Patricia is a well-respected defensive coach who comes from a winning tradition with the New England Patriots. He’s already implemented some new strategies and changes that could pay off in future seasons. Cooter is also seen as a strong offensive coordinator and has had success working with Stafford in the past.</p>
<p>Overall, there’s no question that Detroit has plenty of potential and could turn things around very quickly if they play to their strengths. With a little bit of luck and some good coaching, there’s no reason why they can’t start winning games next season and make a run at the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Against-All-Odds-Detroit-Lions-Hitting-Stand-in-Quest-for-Victory"><a href="#Against-All-Odds-Detroit-Lions-Hitting-Stand-in-Quest-for-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Against All Odds, Detroit Lions Hitting Stand in Quest for Victory"></a>Against All Odds, Detroit Lions Hitting Stand in Quest for Victory</h1><p>In what was considered one of the biggest upsets in NFL history, the Detroit Lions are now 5-0 and in first place in the NFC North. The odds were stacked against them, as they started the season as 3-point underdogs in each game.</p>
<p>This is a team that was written off before the season even started. They lost their star receiver in free agency and traded their top cornerback. Their offensive line was decimated by injuries, and their rookie running back was thrust into a starting role.</p>
<p>But this team has found a way to overcome all of the adversity. They have been led by their quarterback Matthew Stafford, who has played some of the best football of his career. He has completed over 70% of his passes and thrown for 14 touchdowns with only 2 interceptions.</p>
<p>The Lions defense has also been playing well, holding opponents to an average of 18 points per game. They are led by pass rusher Ezekiel Ansah, who has 4 sacks on the season.</p>
<p>The Lions have already beaten some of the top teams in the NFL, including Green Bay, Minnesota, and Philadelphia. And they still have games against Dallas, Seattle, and LA Rams left on their schedule.</p>
<p>So can they continue their hot streak and make it to the playoffs? Anything is possible in the NFL. But regardless of how the rest of the season plays out, this Detroit Lions team has already exceeded all expectations.</p>
