Rumors are circulating that a number of offshore operators are looking to partner up with New York state gaming regulators in order to offer their services to local residents.</p>
<p>While specific names have not yet been released, industry insiders say that the list of potential partners includes bwin.party, 888 Holdings, and Sportingbet. These companies are all expected to apply for licenses from the New York Gaming Commission before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Once licensed, these sites will be able to offer a range of gambling products including casino games, poker, and sports betting. However, they will not be allowed to offer horse or dog racing betting services, as this is currently restricted to just three land-based venues in the state.</p>
<p>While many gamblers are excited at the prospect of legally gambling online in New York, there are some who remain skeptical. Some believe that the state’s gaming commission will not be able to properly regulate these sites,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> and that this could lead to increased instances of fraud and cheating.</p>
<p>Others are concerned about the impact that legal NY online gambling will have on local brick-and-mortar casinos. They worry that these smaller businesses will not be able to compete with the larger operators who dominate the online gambling market.</p>
<h1 id="NY-online-gambling-bill-passes-bringing-online-activities-betting-to-the-state"><a href="#NY-online-gambling-bill-passes-bringing-online-activities-betting-to-the-state" class="headerlink" title="NY online gambling bill passes, bringing online activities betting to the state!"></a>NY online gambling bill passes, bringing online activities betting to the state!</h1><p>On June 13, the New York online gambling bill, also known as S. 6248, passed in the state Senate. This bill authorizes the offering of wagers on certain games, including horseracing and jai-alai, through licensed interactive gaming operators.</p>
<p>Senator John Bonacic is one of the sponsors of this legislation and commented that it will help to generate additional tax revenue for the state. He also believes that it will create new jobs and help to keep New Yorkers engaged in gambling activities within the state’s borders.</p>
<p>The approval of this bill comes just a few weeks after a similar piece of legislation was shot down in the Assembly. That measure, A. 9681, would have allowed for full-blown sports betting within New York State. However, lawmakers decided to amend that bill and voted in favor of S. 6248 instead.</p>
<p>Now that the New York online gambling bill has been approved by both chambers of the state legislature, it will be sent to Governor Andrew Cuomo for his signature. Cuomo has not yet indicated whether or not he plans to sign it into law, but he has supported past measures that would expand gambling options in New York State.</p>
<p>If the bill is signed into law, it will authorize up to ten authorized gaming operators to offer online activities betting from within the state borders. These operators will be subject to stringent regulation from the New York State Gaming Commission, which is charged with overseeing all forms of legal gambling within the state.</p>
<h1 id="Online-gambling-coming-to-NY-–-are-you-ready-for-some-football"><a href="#Online-gambling-coming-to-NY-–-are-you-ready-for-some-football" class="headerlink" title="Online gambling coming to NY – are you ready for some football?"></a>Online gambling coming to NY – are you ready for some football?</h1><p>It’s not just the Super Bowl that has gamblers in a frenzy. Starting on September 13, online gambling is coming to New York! This means that anyone over 21 years of age will be able to place bets on sports, casino games and lottery tickets right from their computer or smartphone.</p>
<p>The idea behind this new law is to bring in more revenue for the state. Gambling addiction experts are concerned that it will also lead to an increase in problem gambling, but lawmakers feel that the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>So far there has been no announcement about which sites will be approved to offer gambling services in New York, but there is sure to be a lot of competition among providers. Sports fans are already gearing up for some serious betting, and casinos are hoping for a revival in fortunes.</p>
<p>Some people are worried that the influx of new gamblers will cause problems for the existing casinos. Many of them are already struggling to compete with the bigger, better options available in other states. It will be interesting to see how things play out over the next few months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to get in on the action, you can start placing bets on overseas sites. Just be careful to choose a reputable site that is licensed and regulated. There have been cases of scams and stolen funds when people have gambled online, so it’s important to do your research first.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-poised-to-become-largest-U-S-market-for-online-sports-betting"><a href="#New-York-poised-to-become-largest-U-S-market-for-online-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="New York poised to become largest U.S. market for online sports betting"></a>New York poised to become largest U.S. market for online sports betting</h1><p>On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had effectively banned sports betting in most states, opening the door for New York to become the country’s largest market for online sports gambling.</p>
<p>The 6-3 ruling in favor of New Jersey was a major victory for the state, which has been trying to legalize sports betting since 2011. In his opinion for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said that the 1992 law, known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), unconstitutionally prohibited states from enacting their own laws legalizing sports gambling.</p>
<p>“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Alito wrote. “Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”</p>
<p>The ruling clears the way for New York and other states to authorize and regulate sports betting within their borders. Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that he plans to introduce legislation authorizing sports betting in New York “as soon as possible” now that PASPA has been overturned.</p>
<p>Cuomo predicted that legalized sports betting would generate $1 billion per year in revenue for the state government, and he urged lawmakers to pass a bill before the end of session later this month. Lawmakers in other states, including California and Massachusetts, have also indicated they plan to move quickly to authorize sports betting in their jurisdictions.</p>

It will be interesting to watch how this unfolds over time…stay tuned!</p>
<h1 id="Bet-on-it-New-York-set-to-legalize-online-sports-betting"><a href="#Bet-on-it-New-York-set-to-legalize-online-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Bet on it: New York set to legalize online sports betting"></a>Bet on it: New York set to legalize online sports betting</h1><p>The New York Assembly is on the verge of legalizing online sports betting, joining a growing number of states that have decided to expand gambling in order to boost state revenues.</p>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, which is expected to be voted on by the end of the week, people over 21 would be allowed to place bets on professional and college sports through websites and mobile apps. The bill would also allow for the construction of new casinos and racetracks.</p>
<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo has expressed support for the measure, saying it would bring in much-needed revenue to the state while creating jobs. The bill has passed in the Senate and now needs only a simple majority in the Assembly to become law.</p>
<p>If approved, New York would join a number of states that have recently legalized online sports betting, including Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia. Nevada and Montana have been offering sports betting for years.</p>
<p>Legalized gambling has been expanding rapidly in recent years as states seek to boost their revenues. In 2017, casino gambling was legal in 40 states, up from 22 states five years earlier. And according to industry experts, online gambling is expected to grow at a rate of about 15 percent per year over the next decade.</p>
<p>The growth of gambling is controversial and has been opposed by some who argue that it can lead to addiction and social problems. But supporters say that it can be an important source of revenue for states, and can also generate jobs in the gaming industry.</p>
