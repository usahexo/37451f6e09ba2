            <h1 id="Sports-Gambling-Bill-narrowly-passes-in-House"><a href="#Sports-Gambling-Bill-narrowly-passes-in-House" class="headerlink" title="Sports Gambling Bill narrowly passes in House"></a>Sports Gambling Bill narrowly passes in House</h1><p>On Tuesday, the House of Representatives narrowly passed the Sports Gambling Bill, allowing states to legalize sports gambling. The vote was close, with 227 voting in favor and 192 voting against.</p>
<p>The Sports Gambling Bill would allow states to legalize sports betting, as long as it is regulated by the state. This would include both professional and collegiate sports. Proponents of the bill argue that this would provide more revenue for states, while opponents argue that this would lead to increased gambling addiction rates.</p>
<p>The bill now moves on to the Senate, where it is expected to pass. If it does, it will then head to President Trump’s desk for approval.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-gambling-now-a-reality-in-the-US"><a href="#Sports-gambling-now-a-reality-in-the-US" class="headerlink" title="Sports gambling now a reality in the US"></a>Sports gambling now a reality in the US</h1><p>Gambling on sporting events has been a part of American culture for over 100 years, but it was only recently that it became a legal reality. In 1992, the federal government passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) which effectively banned sports betting nationwide. However, in May of 2018, the Supreme Court overturned PASPA, allowing individual states to legalize sports gambling.</p>
<p>This new development has created a flurry of activity in the states that have taken advantage of the ruling. For example, New Jersey has seen a dramatic increase in sports betting thanks to its well-developed online gaming industry. Delaware has also seen a surge in gambling activity, with nearly $10 million wagered in the first month after PASPA was overturned.</p>
<p>The potential revenue from sports gambling is huge, and it’s no surprise that states are eager to get in on the action. The American Gaming Association estimates that $150 billion is illegally wagered on sports each year, and that legalizing and regulating the industry could bring in as much as $6 billion annually in tax revenue.</p>
<p>There are some who oppose legalized gambling, arguing that it can lead to addiction and other social ills. However, proponents argue that regulation can help protect consumers and ensure that profits are used for public good. And with so much money at stake, it’s likely that this debate will continue to rage on.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-gambling-bill-heads-to-Senate"><a href="#Sports-gambling-bill-heads-to-Senate" class="headerlink" title="Sports gambling bill heads to Senate"></a>Sports gambling bill heads to Senate</h1><p>A bill that would legalize sports betting in Pennsylvania has passed the House and is now headed to the Senate for a vote. The proposed bill would regulate and tax sports betting in the state, with revenues from the activity going towards education and pension funding.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of several states where sports betting is currently illegal, but there is growing momentum to legalize it in light of last year’s Supreme Court decision striking down a federal ban on the activity. A number of states have already moved to legalize sports gambling in the aftermath of that ruling, including New Jersey, which has been raking in millions in revenue from sports betting.</p>
<p>Sponsors of the Pennsylvania bill say that legalizing and regulating sports betting would bring much-needed revenue to the state. They argue that it would also create jobs and help keep tax dollars in Pennsylvania rather than having them go to other states where gambling is legal.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to addiction and other social problems, and they are calling for further study of the issue before any action is taken.</p>
<p>The Senate is expected to take up the bill in the coming weeks.</p>
<h1 id="First-states-to-legalize-sports-gambling"><a href="#First-states-to-legalize-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="First states to legalize sports gambling"></a>First states to legalize sports gambling</h1><p>After the Supreme Court’s ruling in May 2018 to allow states to legalize sports gambling, a number of states have taken action to do so. The following is a list of the first states to legalize sports gambling and the date they did so.</p>
<p>Delaware – June 5, 2018<br>Nevada – June 14, 2018 New Jersey – June 14, 2018 West Virginia – June 28, 2018 Rhode Island – July 11,2018 Mississippi – August 1,2018<br>Pennsylvania – October 30, 2018</p>
<p>The states that have legalized sports gambling have seen a significant increase in revenue. For example, in Nevada, total gaming revenue was up 3.7% in July 2018 compared to July 2017. In New Jersey, sports betting accounted for $16.4 million of the state’s nearly $300 million in gambling revenue in August 2018. Pennsylvania saw a 49% increase in tax revenue from casino gaming in November 2018 compared to November 2017.</p>
<p>While there are some who oppose legalized sports gambling, the majority of Americans believe it should be legal. A poll by CBS News conducted in May 2018 found that 57% of Americans believe sports gambling should be legal nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-gambling-passing-cause-concern-for-some-professional-athletes"><a href="#Sports-gambling-passing-cause-concern-for-some-professional-athletes" class="headerlink" title="Sports gambling passing cause concern for some professional athletes"></a>Sports gambling passing cause concern for some professional athletes</h1><p>Gambling on sports is becoming increasingly popular, with people risking money on everything from the Super Bowl to who will win the World Series. This has some professional athletes worried, as they feel that their opponents may have an advantage if they know that the person they are playing against has placed a bet on the game.</p>
<p>There is no denying that the lines between gambling and sports have begun to blur in recent years. In some cases, it seems like people are more interested in betting on games than in watching them. This is particularly true when it comes to so-called “exotic” bets, such as whether or not there will be a safety in a given game or how many touchdowns will be scored.</p>
<p>While there is no definitive proof that gambling has had an impact on the outcome of any specific game, it is clear that professional athletes are concerned about it. Many of them feel like they are at a disadvantage when competing against someone who may have inside information about how a particular game is going to play out.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that not all professional athletes oppose gambling on sports. Some of them believe that it is simply a part of the game and that there is no harm in placing a wager every once in a while. Others believe that any potential negative effects can be mitigated by proper regulation and enforcement.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it is up to each individual athlete to decide whether or not he or she wants to participate in sports gambling. However, it is clear that this issue is starting to cause concern for some of them, and it will be interesting to see how it plays out in the years ahead.</p>
