            <h1 id="Nevada-Legalizes-Gambling"><a href="#Nevada-Legalizes-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Legalizes Gambling"></a>Nevada Legalizes Gambling</h1><p>The Nevada state legislature has passed a bill legalizing most forms of gambling. The new law, which goes into effect on January 1st, 2020, will allow casinos, poker rooms, and racetracks to offer gambling services.</p>
<p>While some forms of gambling, such as betting on horse races, have been legal in Nevada for decades, the new law will legalize a wide range of other activities. These include casino games like blackjack and roulette, as well as slot machines and other electronic gaming devices.</p>
<p>The bill was opposed by some religious groups and others who argue that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. However, it was supported by the gaming industry, which argues that legalization will create jobs and generate tax revenue.</p>
<p>Governor Steve Sisolak is expected to sign the bill into law.</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Legalizes-Online-Gambling"><a href="#New-Jersey-Legalizes-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Legalizes Online Gambling"></a>New Jersey Legalizes Online Gambling</h1><p>Legislators in the state of New Jersey have voted to legalize online gambling within the state. This move is seen as a way for New Jersey to bolster its flagging casino industry, which has been struggling in the aftermath of the Great Recession.</p>
<p>Under the new law, online casinos will be licensed and regulated by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. Players will be able to access these casinos from their computers or mobile devices.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state. They also say that it will help keep gambling dollars within New Jersey’s borders, rather than seeing them flow to casinos in other states.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill, meanwhile, fear that it will lead to more addiction and gambling problems. They also argue that it could be difficult to enforce, given that people can gamble from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The bill now heads to Governor Chris Christie’s desk for his signature. Christie has not yet indicated whether he will veto or approve it.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Allows-Gambling-at-Horse-Tracks"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Allows-Gambling-at-Horse-Tracks" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Allows Gambling at Horse Tracks"></a>Pennsylvania Allows Gambling at Horse Tracks</h1><p>Pennsylvania has long been known for its horse tracks, and now these venues will be able to offer gambling in addition to horseracing. The Pennsylvania legislature passed a bill that allows casinos to be built at the state’s horse tracks, with the first facility opening as early as 2020.</p>
<p>The move is seen as a way to bring more revenue to the state, as well as to bolster the horse racing industry. Up until now, gambling has been limited to casinos and lotteries, so this new development represents a major change.</p>
<p>The new casino-at-the-track facilities will offer a variety of gaming options, including slots, table games, and poker. In addition, they will have restaurants and other amenities that will appeal to tourists and other visitors.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear exactly how much revenue the new casinos will generate for the state, but officials are hopeful that they will be a major boost to the economy. The casinos are expected to create thousands of jobs, both directly and indirectly. And they should also provide a significant amount of tax revenue for the government.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy about the move, of course. Some people worry that it will lead to an increase in problem gambling or other negative consequences. But supporters say that the benefits outweigh any potential drawbacks.</p>
<p>Overall, this looks like good news for Pennsylvania residents and businesses alike. The arrival of casino-at-the-track facilities should create jobs and generate much-needed revenue for the state.</p>
<h1 id="West-Virginia-Opens-Casino-in-Charles-Town"><a href="#West-Virginia-Opens-Casino-in-Charles-Town" class="headerlink" title="West Virginia Opens Casino in Charles Town"></a>West Virginia Opens Casino in Charles Town</h1><p>Casino lovers in the state of West Virginia have something to celebrate this week as the state has opened its first casino in Charles Town. The new casino, called Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races, is a joint venture between Penn National Gaming and Charles Town Races.</p>
<p>The new casino has been in the works for several years, with an estimated cost of $230 million. It took over the racetrack and other gambling operations from Maryland Live! Casino, which is owned by Caesars Entertainment Corporation. Hollywood Casino at Charles Town Races features more than 2,500 slot machines, 70 table games, and a 28-table poker room.</p>
<p>West Virginia Governor Jim Justice was on hand for the ribbon cutting ceremony and said that the casino will “ create thousands of jobs and bring millions of dollars of economic development to our state.” He also noted that the casino “will be a huge asset to our tourism industry.”</p>
<p>The new casino isn’t the only attraction in Charles Town. The town is also home to the Museum of American History, which features exhibits on George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and other famous Americans.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Licenses-6-more-Casinos"><a href="#Delaware-Licenses-6-more-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Licenses 6 more Casinos"></a>Delaware Licenses 6 more Casinos</h1><p>The state of Delaware has just announced that it will be licensing six new casinos. This is great news for the thousands of people who work in the casino industry, as well as for the many Delawareans who enjoy gambling.</p>
<p>The new casinos will be spread out across the state, with one each in New Castle, Kent, and Sussex counties. They are expected to create 1,000 jobs and bring in $175 million in tax revenue annually. In addition, they will generate $1.3 billion in economic activity each year.</p>
<p>This is a major victory for Delaware’s casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years. The new casinos will help to revive it and make it more competitive with surrounding states.</p>
<p>Delaware’s decision to license more casinos is also good news for the country as a whole. It will help to create jobs and stimulate the economy.</p>
