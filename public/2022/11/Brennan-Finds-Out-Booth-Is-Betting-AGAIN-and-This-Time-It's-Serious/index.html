This time, it’s serious - he’s lost a lot of money and he’s in over his head. Brennan tries to talk to him about it, but Booth just clams up. He won’t tell her how much money he’s lost or where he’s been gambling, but she can see the fear in his eyes.</p>
<p>Brennan does some digging and finds out that Booth has been gambling at a casino downtown. She goes down there to try to talk to him, but he won’t listen to her. He’s convinced that he can win his money back if he just keeps playing. Brennan knows that Booth is in over his head and that he’s going to lose everything if she doesn’t do something.</p>
<p>She comes up with a plan: she’ll make a deal with the casino owner, telling him that she’ll pay off Booth’s debt if he agrees to stop letting Booth gamble. The owner agrees, but only on the condition that Booth never gambles again. Brennan knows this is the only way to save Booth from himself.</p>
<p>Booth is angry when he finds out what Brennan has done, but eventually he realizes that she was only trying to help him. He thanks her for saving him and they both agree never to mention the whole incident again.</p>
<h1 id="Brennan-Finds-Out-Booth-Is-Betting-AGAIN-and-He’s-in-DEEP"><a href="#Brennan-Finds-Out-Booth-Is-Betting-AGAIN-and-He’s-in-DEEP" class="headerlink" title="Brennan Finds Out Booth Is Betting AGAIN and He’s in DEEP"></a>Brennan Finds Out Booth Is Betting AGAIN and He’s in DEEP</h1><p>Brennan has been Booth’s best friend for years, so when she finds out he’s been betting again - and this time, he’s in deep - she knows she needs to do something to help him.</p>
<p>Booth has always been a risk-taker, but his gambling addiction has taken things to a new level. He’s been borrowing money from all sorts of people, and he’s even started stealing from work to make his bets. Brennan knows that if Booth doesn’t get help soon, he could wind up in serious trouble.</p>
<p>She tries to talk to him about it, but Booth is in denial. He insists that he can handle things on his own and doesn’t want her help. Brennan knows that she can’t just sit back and watch her friend destroy himself, so she comes up with a plan.</p>
<p>She arranges for Booth to meet with a professional gambler who can help him get his addiction under control. Booth is resistant at first, but after hearing how bad things have gotten, he agrees to meet with the man.</p>
<p>The gamble pays off, and Booth is able to get his addiction under control. He’s not cured overnight, but with the help of the professional gambler and Brennan by his side, he’s on the road to recovery.</p>
<h1 id="Brennan-Finds-Out-Booth-Is-Betting-AGAIN-and-She’s-Pissed"><a href="#Brennan-Finds-Out-Booth-Is-Betting-AGAIN-and-She’s-Pissed" class="headerlink" title="Brennan Finds Out Booth Is Betting AGAIN and She’s Pissed"></a>Brennan Finds Out Booth Is Betting AGAIN and She’s Pissed</h1><p>It’s been a few weeks since Booth and Brennan have talked about the money he’s been betting, and Brennan is finally ready to talk to him about it.</p>
<p>“Booth, we need to talk about the money you’ve been betting.”</p>
<p>“What about it?” Booth asks innocently.</p>
<p>“You know exactly what I’m talking about. You’ve been betting on sports, and you know I don’t approve of that.”</p>
<p>“I know, Bren, but I can handle it. I’m not going to lose any money.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point,” Brennan argues. “You’re risking money that you don’t have, and you could lose everything. I don’t want that happening.”</p>
<p>“Brennan, I can take care of myself,” Booth insists. “I’m not going to let anything bad happen.”</p>
<p>“But what if something does happen? What if you lose all your money? What am I going to do then?” Brennan asks, her voice shaking slightly.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Bren,” Booth says comfortingly. “I’ll be fine. I promise.”</p>
<h1 id="Brennan-Finds-Out-Booth-Is-Betting-AGAIN-and-He’s-Going-to-Jail"><a href="#Brennan-Finds-Out-Booth-Is-Betting-AGAIN-and-He’s-Going-to-Jail" class="headerlink" title="Brennan Finds Out Booth Is Betting AGAIN and He’s Going to Jail"></a>Brennan Finds Out Booth Is Betting AGAIN and He’s Going to Jail</h1><p>This article is spoiler free.</p>
<p>Brennan has a feeling that Booth is betting again and when she asks him about it, he doesn’t deny it. This leads to a major argument and Brennan kicks Booth out of her lab.</p>
<p>Booth goes to his old friend, Angela, for advice and she tells him that he needs to tell Brennan the truth. So he goes back to Brennan’s lab and tells her the truth.</p>
<p>She’s not happy about it, but she agrees to help him get out of this mess. They go to the FBI and tell them what’s going on.</p>
<p>Luckily, they’re able to work something out and Booth doesn’t have to go to jail. Brennan also agrees to stay with Booth and help him get over his gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Brennan-Finds-Out-Booth-Is-Betting-AGAIN-and-She-Wants-Him-to-Stop"><a href="#Brennan-Finds-Out-Booth-Is-Betting-AGAIN-and-She-Wants-Him-to-Stop" class="headerlink" title="Brennan Finds Out Booth Is Betting AGAIN and She Wants Him to Stop"></a>Brennan Finds Out Booth Is Betting AGAIN and She Wants Him to Stop</h1><p>Brennan is not happy that Booth is betting again. It was bad enough when he was gambling and now it seems like he’s just going to ruin their lives with this new habit. Brennan wants him to stop and she’s going to do everything she can to make sure that happens.</p>
<p>She starts by talking to him about it. She’s straightforward and honest with him, telling him that she doesn’t like what he’s doing and wants him to stop. Booth listens but doesn’t say much in response. He doesn’t seem too interested in stopping, which worries Brennan even more.</p>
<p>She keeps trying, though. She brings it up every time they talk and tries to find ways to get through to Booth. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t, but she’s not going to give up. She knows how important Booth is to her and she doesn’t want anything to come between them.</p>
<p>Finally, after months of trying, Brennan is able to get through to Booth. He agrees to stop betting and they both seem happier for it. They can move on and concentrate on their relationship without this big issue looming over them. Brennan is glad that they were able to work things out and grateful that Booth was willing to listen to her and change his ways.</p>
